Chat with your documents (pdf, csv, text) using Openai model, LangChain and Chainlit

### Chat with your documents üöÄ
- [OpenAI model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) as Large Language model
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/huggingface_hub.html) as a Framework for LLM
- [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/langchain) for deploying.

## System Requirements

You must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of python may not compile.

1. Fork this repository and create a codespace in GitHub as I showed you in the youtube video OR Clone it locally.
```
git clone https://github.com/sudarshan-koirala/langchain-openai-chainlit.git
cd langchain-openai-chainlit
```

2. Rename example.env to .env with `cp example.env .env`and input the OpenAI API key as follows. Get OpenAI API key from this [URL](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You need to create an account in OpenAI webiste if you haven't already.
   ```
